# Generative Arp for Zynthian

**English** · [Русский](README.ru.md)

An LV2 MIDI plugin that turns into a generative arpeggiator for [Zynthian](https://zynthian.org)
(tested on Zynthian *Vangelis* on a Raspberry Pi 5). It has a step pattern with probability, pitch shift,
velocity and gate per step, each row with its own length (polyrhythm), scales, a Turing‑Machine‑style
note loop, slow mutation of the pattern, and a touchscreen widget for editing the steps.

## Install

On the Zynthian (it builds on the device):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmtry3/zynthian-generative-arp.git
cd zynthian-generative-arp
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
sudo systemctl restart zynthian
```

`install.sh` builds the plugin and creates two symlinks:
- `/usr/local/lib/lv2/generative_arp.lv2` → `build/generative_arp.lv2`;
- the widget into `/zynthian/zynthian-ui/zyngui/widgets_user/`.

It also refreshes Zynthian's preset list for this plugin. Nothing else in Zynthian is changed.
Remove it with `sudo ./scripts/uninstall.sh`, which only deletes the links.

Update:

```bash
git pull && sudo ./scripts/install.sh && sudo systemctl restart zynthian
```

In Zynthian, add **Generative Arp** to a chain as a MIDI tool in front of a synth. Zynthian shows it in
the *Other* category: the category can't be set from the plugin, but you can change it in webconf → Engines.

## How it plays

Hold a chord and the arpeggiator plays its notes one per step.

**Transport.**
- **Stopped:** the arp runs on its own clock at the Zynthian tempo, and the first note sounds as
  soon as you press a key.
- **Playing:** steps are locked to the song grid. A new chord comes in on the next step of the grid.
  Starting the transport or jumping to another position silences the sounding note.

**Note order** follows the last played pitch. If you add a note to the chord, Up continues upward from
where it was rather than starting over.

**Other MIDI.** Notes are played on the channel of the key that produced them. Other MIDI (CC, pitch
bend…) passes through. All Notes Off / All Sound Off (CC 123 / 120) also clears the held and latched notes.

## Controls

The controllers are grouped into pages of four:

| Page | Control | Values | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arp | Rate | 1/4, 1/8, 1/8T, 1/16, 1/16T, 1/32 | step length |
| | Gate % | 5–100 | note length as a share of the step, unless a step sets its own |
| | Order | Up, Down, Up‑Down, Down‑Up, As played, Random, Loop | order of the chord notes (see below) |
| | Octaves | 1–4 | the chord repeated over this many octaves |
| Pattern | Latch | on/off | the chord keeps playing after the keys are released |
| | Transpose | −2 … +2 octaves | added to every note at the very end |
| | Repeats | 1–5, Rnd 3, Rnd 5 | how many steps each chord note plays |
| | Rpt mode | Same, Run up, Run down, Octave, Echo | what the repeats do |
| Lengths | Prob len, Shift len, Vel len, Gate len | 1–16 | length of each pattern row (polyrhythm) |
| Scale | Key | C … B | tonic |
| | Scale | Chromatic, Major, Minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Harm minor, Mel minor, Major pent, Minor pent, Blues | scale for Shift |
| Mutate | Notes % | 0–100 | Loop order only: chance that a loop step gets a new note |
| | Loop len | 1–16 | Loop order only: length of the note loop |
| | Steps % | 0–100 | any order: chance that a step of the pattern drifts |
| | Reset | toggle | any change: clear the drift, and make a new note loop |
| Groove | Swing % | 50–75 | delay of the swung steps (50 = straight) |
| | Swing feel | Pairs, Fours, Drag, Threes | which steps are delayed and how much |
| | Drunk % | 0–100 | timing slowly drifts late (up to 1/4 step) |
| | Accent % | 0–100 | undelayed steps louder, delayed ones softer and shorter |

### Order

- **Up / Down:** low to high, or high to low, and then repeat.
- **Up‑Down / Down‑Up:** up and down without repeating the top and bottom notes.
- **As played:** in the order the keys were pressed, octave by octave.
- **Random:** a random chord note, never the same one twice in a row.
- **Loop:** in the style of the Turing Machine. The loop has *Loop len* steps and stores positions in the
  chord (lowest, middle, highest…), not notes. A new chord keeps the shape of the loop with the new notes.
  - *Notes %* is the chance that a step gets a new random position when it plays: at 0 % the loop is
    frozen, at 100 % every note is new.
  - The loop survives releasing the keys and changing chords, and is new after each Zynthian start or *Reset*.

### Latch

- **On:** released keys keep playing. A new chord, pressed after all keys were released, replaces the old one.
- **Off:** only the keys still held keep playing.

The control can be mapped to a button on a MIDI controller (Zynthian's MIDI learn; use the momentary
switch option in the binding settings if you want it to act only while held).

### Repeats

Each chord note plays for several grid steps before the note order moves on: Up with *Repeats 2* gives
`C C E E G G`. *Rnd 3* / *Rnd 5* pick 1–3 / 1–5 repeats at random for every new note.

- A repeat is a normal step: the pattern rows keep advancing, so the repeats get their own probability,
  shift, velocity and gate (and the polyrhythm keeps turning). A silent step still counts as a repeat.
- *Rpt mode* changes the repeats (not the first note):
  - **Same:** the same note.
  - **Run up / Run down:** each repeat one scale note higher / lower (semitones with Chromatic):
    in C major Up with 3 repeats gives `C D E  E F G  G A B`.
  - **Octave:** every other repeat an octave up (`C C' C C'`).
  - **Echo:** each repeat at 70 % of the previous velocity.
- The Loop order and its mutation advance once per chord note, not per repeat.

### Groove

Steps can only be delayed, never played early (the plugin does not look ahead).

- **Swing %** sets the full delay: 50 % = straight, 75 % = half a step. Useful values: 57 % ≈ septuplet,
  60 % ≈ quintuplet, 67 % ≈ triplet swing. The swing counts arp steps (*Rate*): at 1/16 it swings sixteenths.
  Positions follow the song grid, so with the transport running the swing lines up with Zynthian's drums.
- **Swing feel**: the share of the full delay for each step position:
  - **Pairs:** `0 1` (classic swing).
  - **Fours:** `0 ½ 1 ½` (eighth-note swing with sixteenth steps).
  - **Drag:** `0 ⅓ ⅔ 1` (the beat drags and snaps back on the downbeat).
  - **Threes:** `0 1 0` (groups of 3 steps: 3 against 4).
- **Drunk %**: an extra delay of up to 1/4 step that wanders slowly (a random walk): a few notes lag,
  then catch up. Different after every Zynthian start.
- **Accent %**: velocity and gate by the feel. At 100 % undelayed positions go to velocity 127, fully
  delayed ones down to 30 % of their velocity and half their gate (½-delayed: in between). Works at
  Swing 50 % too, as a pure accent groove; the gate part is heard even on synths that ignore velocity.
  Ties stay ties.
- Gate is measured from each note's own start; a note that would overlap the next one is cut by it.

## The pattern (widget)

The plugin's screen in Zynthian shows a touch editor for the 16 steps of the pattern.

- **Tabs Prob · Shift · Vel · Gate** choose the row. Each tab shows the length of its row.
- **Touch or drag a bar** to set the step's value by height. A fast swipe fills the steps in between.
- **Double tap a bar** to reset that step to its default.
- **Tap a step number** under the bars to set the length of the current row.
- **Playhead:** the step playing now is highlighted in each row (rows have their own lengths).
- **Mutation marks:** a white mark on a bar shows the value the step plays now after mutation. The bar
  keeps the drawn value.

| Row | Values | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prob | 0–100 % | 100 | chance that the step plays |
| Shift | −24 … +24 semitones | 0 | added to the chosen chord note |
| Vel | 0–200 % | 100 | of the key velocity (result 1–127) |
| Gate | Global, 5–100 %, Tie | Global | note length; Global uses the Gate % control |

**Tie.** The note holds until the next step.
- If the next note is the same pitch, it just continues (several Ties make one long note).
- If the next note is different, it starts before the previous one stops (legato), which mono synths
  with legato or portamento play as one phrase.
- A Tie ends on a silent step or when the keys are released.

**Polyrhythm.** Every row runs on its own length over the same step counter, e.g. notes every 3 steps
and accents every 4 meet again after 12. The counter starts at the first key after all keys were
released. *Loop len* is a fifth such length, for the Loop order.

## Scales

With a scale selected, Shift stays in semitones but sticks to the scale:
- **In the widget,** Shift only takes the scale's intervals from the tonic. In A minor that is
  0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12 and the same downwards. The Shift tab shows the scale.
- **In the plugin,** a shifted note that falls outside the scale (the chord note may be any note)
  moves to the nearest scale note. A tie goes in the direction of the shift.
- **Shift 0** leaves the played note as it is, even if it isn't in the scale.
- **Changing the scale** moves the Shift steps into the new scale in the widget. Between 7‑note scales
  the degree is kept (minor +3 → major +4); otherwise the nearest allowed value is used.

## Mutation

**Steps %** works with any order. When a step plays, with this chance one of its rows moves by one
notch, and you hear it right away:

| Row | One notch | Furthest from the drawn value |
|---|---|---|
| Prob | 20 % | 3 notches |
| Shift | the next scale note (a semitone in Chromatic) | 3 notches |
| Vel | 20 % | 3 notches |
| Gate | 5 % (Global counts from Gate %; Tie can't go higher) | 4 notches |

- At the limit a step can only move back, so the pattern "breathes" and stays recognizable.
- **0 %** freezes the pattern as it has grown.
- **Reset** brings everything back to the drawn pattern.
- **Touching a step** in the widget clears the drift of that row of that step.
- The drawn pattern itself is never changed.

## Presets

Presets use the standard Zynthian preset list and *Save preset*. A preset stores all controls and the
whole pattern. The factory bank **Factory** has:

- **Init:** everything at defaults.
- **Accent Bass:** accents, skipped steps, ties and octave jumps.
- **Polyrhythm 7‑3‑4‑5:** row lengths 7/3/4/5, Up‑Down over 2 octaves.
- **Turing A minor:** Loop order in A minor with slow note mutation.
- **Breathing C major:** a pattern in C major with step mutation.
- **Scale Runs D dorian:** random repeats (Rnd 3) running up the scale from each chord note.

Snapshots work too: Zynthian saves the controls and the pattern.

What is not saved: the grown mutation (step drift and the note loop). It lives only while the plugin runs.

## Build and test without a Zynthian

Needs `gcc`, `pkg-config`, `lv2-dev` (and `python3-tk` for the widget preview).

```bash
./scripts/build.sh               # build/generative_arp.lv2
./scripts/test.sh                # tests of the arpeggiator logic (src/arp_core.c, no LV2)
python3 test/widget_preview.py   # widget touch scenarios; --show opens a window
python3 scripts/gen_presets.py   # regenerate lv2/presets.ttl and lv2/manifest.ttl
```

Logs on the device: `journalctl -u zynthian`.
